* W 5pm: Post-lecture quiz due
* F 5pm: Problem set due

## Lecture topics

The course is divided into broad sections that appear in the left panel of this site. Each section contains several pages, one for each lecture. The top of each page will denote the tentative date that the material will be covered, though dates may adjust based on feedback in lecture.

One deviation from the order is that "Software and Coding" is a reference topic at the bottom of the set.
