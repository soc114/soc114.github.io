Together, we will use tools from data science to answer social science questions. As an area of application, we will focus on questions about inequality and social stratification.

## Learning goals

As a result of participating in this course, students will be able to

- connect theories about inequality to quantitative empirical evidence
- evaluate the effects of hypothetical interventions to reduce inequality
- conduct data analysis using the R programming language

Working with data to understand inequality brings me joy and meaning, as I first discovered as a college student years ago. I hope to share that joy with you! Other joys of mine include hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.
