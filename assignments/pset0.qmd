title: "Problem Set 0: Computing environment"
---

**Due: 5pm on Friday, January 10.**

This problem set is a Quarto document, which embeds code, results, and written work. You will edit it and then create a PDF. If you are new to Quarto, see the [Quarto tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) for additional information.

To complete the problem set, download <a href="../assets/pset0/pset0.qmd" download>pset0.qmd</a>. Add these four lines of code to the top if they do not appear in your download,

```{r, eval = F}
---
title: "Problem Set 0: Computing environment"
format: pdf
---
```

and render to a PDF. You will then submit two things:

1) Upload the rendered PDF to BruinLearn
2) In our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMxlewBaz7QJ3uKNCsj2g5rukOOumqrZVAnu-ckybbfwvFsg/viewform?usp=sf_link), tell us your anonymous identifier that appears in your rendered PDF.

## Help with getting started

If you are stuck, make sure that you first follow the installation instructions in [setting up your computer](../topics/r_basics.qmd).

Open the downloaded problem set in RStudio. You should then click
the "Render" button as shown in the image below.

![](../assets/pset0/render.png)
This will run the R code and combine the output with the text in the document
into a PDF. By default, this PDF will be output in the same directory that
you saved `pset0.qmd` in. You will then submit the PDF on Canvas.

<!-- If you're not sure what your working directory is, run `getwd()` in your -->
<!-- RStudio console. This will print your working directory. You can set it to the place you've saved this file by clicking the top menu Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location. -->
