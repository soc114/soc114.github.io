  PRIMARY VARIABLE

 
             ASVAB MATH_VERBAL SCORE PERCENT
 
To calculate the ASVAB_MATH_VERBAL_SCORE_PCT, NLS Program staff first grouped 
respondents into three-month age groups.  That is, the oldest cohort included 
those born from January through March of 1980, while the youngest were born from
October through December 1984 (a total of 20 cohorts, with an average of about 
350 respondents per cohort).  Custom sampling weights (computed for the sample 
of 7,093 respondents who have scores on all four exams) were assigned for each 
respondent's scores.  Within each three-month age group and using the sampling 
weights, we assigned percentiles for the theta scores for the tests on 
Mathematical Knowledge (MK), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Word Knowledge (WK), and
Paragraph Comprehension (PC) based on the weighted number of respondents scoring
below each score.  We added the percentile scores for WK and PC to get an 
aggregate Verbal score (V) for which an aggregated intra-group, internally 
normed, percentile was then computed.  NLS Program staff then added the 
percentile scores for MK, AR and two times the aggregated percentile for V.  
Finally, within each group we computed a percentile score, using the weights, on
this aggregate score, yielding a final value between zero and 99.
 
COMMENT: USERS SHOULD NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH THE FORMULA IS SIMILAR TO THE AFQT 
SCORE GENERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR THE NLSY79 COHORT, THIS 
VARIABLE REFLECTS WORK DONE BY NLS PROGRAM STAFF AND IS NEITHER GENERATED NOR 
ENDORSED BY DOD.  FOR MORE DETAILS, USERS SHOULD READ THE NLSY97 USER'S GUIDE 
SECTION ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAT-ASVAB, ASVAB_MATH_VERBAL SCORE_PCT.

valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($ 70,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases
at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the

valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($ 97,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases
at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the

valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($ 105,000 for this variable).  Values for all 
cases at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each 
of the top 2 percent of the cases.

valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($ 125,000 for this variable).  Values for all 
cases at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each 
of the top 2 percent of the cases.

valid non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is
used as the truncation level ($ 145,000 for this variable).  Values for all 
cases at or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each
