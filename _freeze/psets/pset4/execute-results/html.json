This exercise seeks to estimate the proportion employed among married men and women^[Each married pair need not be of different sex. The data include same-sex couples.] with a 1-year-old child at home. Our data include those with at least one child age 0--18.\n\n## Synthetic data\n\nTo speed data access, we downloaded data from the basic monthly Current Population Survey for all months from 2010--2019. We processed these data, grouped by sex and age of the youngest child, and estimated the proportion employed. We then generated **synthetic data**: we created a new dataset for you to use with simulated people using these known probabilities.\n\nSynthetic data is good in our setting for two reasons\n\n1) we know the answer\n2) you can download the synthetic data right from this website\n\nFor transparency, here is the [code](../code/synthetic_parents.R) with which we created the synthetic data. The line below will load the [synthetic data](../data/parents.csv).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nparents <- read_csv(\"https://soc114.github.io/data/parents.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYour synthetic data intentionally omits any parents with child age 1. Here is a graph showing the averages in your data, grouped by child age and sex.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](pset4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Your task\n\nPredict the proportion employed among female respondents whose youngest child is 1 year old.\n\nThis subgroup at which to make a prediction is:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntarget_population <- tibble(sex = \"female\", child_age = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou will estimate several models to predict `at_work` as a function of `sex` and `child_age`.\n\n## Linear regression\n\n1. Estimate an additive OLS model for `at_work` as an additive function of `sex` and `child_age`. Store it in `ols_additive`.\n2. Visualize the additive model. Create a `ggplot()` in which the $x$-axis is `child_age`, the color is `sex`, and the $y$-axis has predictions from `ols_additive`. Store this plot in `ols_additive_plot`.\n3. Estimate an interactive OLS model for `at_work` as a interactive function of `sex` and `child_age`. Store it in an object `ols_interactive`.\n4. Visualize the interactive model. Create a `ggplot()` in which the $x$-axis is `child_age`, the color is `sex`, and the $y$-axis has predictions from `ols_interactive`. Store this plot in `ols_interactive_plot`.\n5. Use either OLS model to predict the outcome in the target population. Store your predicted value (a number) in an object `ols_prediction`.\n\n## Logistic regression\n\n6. Estimate a logistic regression model to predict `at_work` as a function of `sex` and `child_age`. You can use any functional form you want. Store it in an object `logistic_regression`.\n7. Visualize the logistic regression model. Create a `ggplot()` in which the $x$-axis is `child_age`, the color is `sex`, and the $y$-axis has predictions from `logistic_regression`. Store this plot in `logistic_plot`.\n8. Use your logistic regression model to predict the probability of being `at_work` in the target population. Store your predicted value (a number) in an object `logistic_prediction`.\n\n## Your approach\n\nUltimately, this problem set is a challenge: who can best predict the outcome in `target_population`?\n\nYou can use any approach. A model from above, one of them learned on data from a subgroup (e.g., those with `child_age` under 5), or one with a different functional form (e.g., you can use nonlinear terms for `child_age`). You can also estimate model-free by taking some subsample mean. You can use any method. If your approach will use a package we have not used in class, let us know on Piazza so that we can ensure the autograder has installed this package.\n\n9. Store your predicted probability (a number) for `target_population` in an object called `my_prediction`.\n\nWe will extract `my_prediction` from your submitted problem sets, see who is closest, and announce a winner in class!\n\n",
