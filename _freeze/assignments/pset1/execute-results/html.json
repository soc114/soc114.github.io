Check out the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZDC4zNsn4aKboRiFDKGtQysgMYgcWnKkSxboz9ORKkUJHbg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n:::\n\nStudent identifer: [type your anonymous identifier here]\n\n- Use this <a href=\"../assets/pset1/pset1.qmd\" download>pset1.qmd</a> to complete the problem set\n- In Canvas, you will upload the PDF produced by your .qmd file\n- Put your identifier above, not your name! We want anonymous grading to be possible\n\nThis problem set involves both data analysis and reading.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nThis problem set uses the data [`lifeCourse.csv`](../data/lifeCourse.csv).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlifeCourse <- read_csv(\"https://soc114.github.io/data/lifeCourse.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe data contain life course earnings profiles for four cohorts of American workers: those born in 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970. Each row contains a summary of the annual earnings distribution for a particular birth cohort at a particular age, among the subgroup with a particular level of education. To prepare these data, we aggregated microdata from the [Current Population Survey](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/), provided through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\nThe data contain five variables.\n\n1. `quantity` is the metric by which the earnings distribution is summarized: 10th, 50th, or 90th percentile\n2. `education` is the educational subgroup being summarized: College Degree, Less than College\n3. `cohort` is the cohort (people with a given birth year) to which these data apply: 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970\n4. `age` is the age at which earnings were measured: 30--45\n5. `income` is the value for the given earnings percentile in the given subgroup. Income values are provided in 2022 dollars\n\n## 1. Visualize (40 points)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip\n\nFunctions named in this problem are links to helper pages that provide documentation.\n:::\n\nUse [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to visualize these data. To denote the different trajectories,\n\n- make your plot using [`geom_point()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html) or [`geom_line()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html)\n- use the x-axis for `age`\n- use the y-axis for `income`\n- use [`color`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#sec-adding-aesthetics-layers) for `quantity`\n- use [`facet_grid`](https://ggplot2-book.org/facet#facet-grid) to make a panel of facets where each row is an education value and each column is a cohort value\n\nYou should prepare the graph as though you were going to publish it. Modify the axis titles so that a reader would know what is on the axis. Use appropriate capitalization in all labels. Optionally, try using the [`label_currency()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/label_currency.html) function from the `scales` package so that the y-axis uses dollar values.\n\nYour code should be well-formatted as defined by [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style.html). In your produced PDF, no lines of code should run off the page.\n\nMany different graphs can be equally correct. You will be evaluated by\n\n- having publication-ready graph aesthetics\n- code that follows style conventions\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# your code goes here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Understand components of research question\n\nThe graph above answered a descriptive research question. Here are a few components of that question:\n\nA) Annual income in 2022 dollars\nB) American workers in each subgroup defined by birth cohort, age, and education\nC) 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile\nD) A person\n\nFor 2.1--2.4, write the letter of the corresponding component of the research question.\n\n**2.1 (2.5 points)** What is the unit of analysis?\n\n**2.2 (2.5 points)** What is the outcome variable?\n\n**2.3 (2.5 points)** What are the target populations?\n\n**2.4 (2.5 points)** What are the summary statistics?\n\n<!-- ## 3. Interpret the graph -->\n\n<!-- Write 2-3 sentences summarizing what your figure shows. -->\n\n<!-- **3.1 (3 points).** Focus on those born in 1970. For those with a college degree, how do the top and bottom of the income distribution change over the life course? -->\n\n<!-- > Type your answer here. -->\n\n<!-- **3.2 (3 points).** Focus on those born in 1970. How does the pattern in the 90th percentile differ for those with and without college degrees? -->\n\n<!-- > Type your answer here. -->\n\n\n<!-- ## 4. Connect to reading -->\n\n<!-- Read p. 1--7 of following paper. Stop before the section \"Analytic Framework for Decomposing Inequality.\" -->\n\n<!-- > Cheng, Siwei. 2021. [The shifting life course patterns of wage inequality.](https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soab003). _Social Forces_ 100(1):1--28. -->\n\n<!-- Our data are not the same as Cheng's. But our analysis is able to reproduce many of her findings. Answer each question in two sentences or less. -->\n\n<!-- Cheng discusses period trends, cohort trends, and age trends.  -->\n\n<!-- **4.1 (3 points)** Describe a cohort trend that you see in your graph. -->\n\n<!-- > Type your answer here. -->\n\n<!-- **4.2 (3 points)** Describe an age trend that you see in your graph. -->\n\n<!-- > Type your answer here. -->\n\n<!-- **4.3 (5 points)** Describe two ways that our results align with the arguments in the paper. -->\n\n<!-- > Type your answer here. -->\n\n## Recap and connections to your project\n\nThe visualization you produced in this problem set is an example of the kind of visualization you will produce in the final project. As in this problem set, your visualization in the project should include well-written labels to make the graph readable. A difference between the two is that in this problem set we provided a dataset in which each row was already a summary statistic. In the final project, you will manipulate data in which each row corresponds to a unit of analysis that you aggregate to produce a summary statistic. This is a skill you will practice on the next problem set.\n\n",
