See the [**honors section syllabus**](assets/syllabus_honors.pdf).

Any student enrolled in Soc 114 is welcome to enroll in the honors section (Soc 189 Sem 3). The honors section is graded as a separate 1.0 credit course. It is an opportunity to engage in a small creative research project and interact with the professor and peers in a seminar format. More information will be posted on this page in the future.
