title: "Final Project"
---

The culmination of the course is a group research project. You will

- create your own research question (one descriptive and one causal)
- download your own data
- visualize the data
- interpret your findings

You can answer any question using the ideas we learned in this course.

## What you will submit

There are two submitted items, both due 5pm on Friday, Mar 7.

**Writeup.** A `.qmd` document compiled into a PDF. It should include all code that produces your results. This must be no more than 1,000 words and will contain 1 or more visualizations.

**Slides.** A PDF that you will present in discussion. Keep text to a minimum in the slides. You should plan to have all group members speak during the presentation. Your presentation should be 10 minutes or less.

## Group structure

We will form groups of about 5 students each within discussion sections. Groups will be formed during discussion in the middle of the quarter.

## Key components of the project

Your goal should be to **tell us a story** using the data. What do we learn by studying this outcome, aggregated this way, in these subgroups from this population?

A few points should be part of your writeup:

1) Define your unit of analysis
2) Define your target population
     - Motivate: why is this population interesting to study?
3) Describe how your sample was chosen from that population
     - this may be a probability sample, such as those available via IPUMS. If so, tell us a little bit about the sampling design
     - this may be a convenience sample. If so, why does it speak to the population and what are the limitations?
     - this may be data on the entire population, as in our [baseball](../topics/sampling.qmd#sec-baseball) example
4) Choose an outcome variable, which is defined for each unit in the population.
     - example: annual wage and salary income
5) Choose one or more variables on which to create population subgroups
     - example: subgroups defined by sex (male and female)
6) Choose a summary statistic, which aggregates the outcome distribution to one summary per subgroup
     - examples: proportion, mean, median, 90th percentile
7) Answer one descriptive and one causal question (see below)
8) Present results using `ggplot()`

With these components in mind, you will answer one descriptive and one causal research question.

**Descriptive research question.** For this question, write your results carefully using only descriptive language. As a heuristic, if your goal is descriptive then you should not be using the sentence structure "X [verb] Y", such as "going to college increases earnings." This claim suggests a college graduate would have earned less if they had not gone to college---a counterfactual outcome we did not see. For truly descriptive claims, you should phrase more like: "There is a difference in earnings among those who did and did not go to college." A heuristic to recognize a non-causal claim is that it can be phrased it in an "among" statement: "Among subgroup A, we find \_\_\_. Among subgroup B, we find \_\_\_." Or "There is a disparity in Y across subgroups defined by X."

**Causal research question.** Define your potential outcomes. Draw a DAG in which those potential outcomes can be identified by an assumption of conditional exchangeability. If there are unmeasured confounders, discuss how their omission from your DAG may threaten the credibility of your estimates. It is ok if the assumptions are doubtful as long as you write them down clearly.

## Considerations to bear in mind

- **Weights.** If your sample is drawn from the population with unequal probabilities, you should use sampling weights
- **Models.** If your question involves many subgroups (e.g., ages) with few observations in each subgroup, you can (but are not required to) use a statistical model to estimate your summary statistic in the subgroup by a predicted value. For example, you could use OLS to predict the proportion mean income at each age. If you do this, you should report the predicted value of the summary statistic, not the coefficients of the model.
- **Aggregation.** Your data must begin with units (e.g., people) who you aggregate into subgroups (e.g., age groups). Your data might come pre-aggregated, such as data where each row contains data for all students in a particular college or university. Then you would need to aggregate further, such as to produce summaries for private versus public universities.
- **Dropped cases.** As you move from raw data to the data that produce your graph, you might drop cases on the way. For example, some cases may have missing values on key predictors. Report how many are dropped, and why. Our goal here is transparent, open science.

## Have fun

As a teaching team, the project is our favorite part of the course. Preparing you to succeed in the project has been (in some sense) the entire goal of all that precedes the project in the course. We hope you will find joy in answering questions with data, as we do.
