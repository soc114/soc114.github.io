\begin{frame}{Why experiments ``work'': Exchangeability}

In random experiments, the distribution of \textbf{potential outcomes} for those who are treated and those who are not treated (control group) are identically distributed!

$$\{Y^1,Y^0\}\indep A$$

\vspace{2em}
This is \textbf{exchangeability} \vskip .2in

\textbf{Question.} Does exchangeability imply $Y\indep A$?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why experiments ``work'': Exchangeability}

Exchangeability is about \textbf{potential} rather than \textbf{observed} outcomes
$$\{Y^0,Y^1\}\indep A\qquad\text{rather than}\qquad Y\not\indep A$$
 \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential outcomes are independent of treatment $\{Y^0,Y^1\}\indep A$
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Risk of covid under no vaccine ($Y^0$) is the same for those with and without a vaccine
\end{itemize} \pause
\item Observed outcomes are not independent of treatment $Y\not\indep A$
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Risk of covid is lower for those with the vaccine
\item Why? Because for them $Y = Y^1$. For others, $Y = Y^0$.
\item If $A$ affects $Y$, then $Y\not\indep A$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} \pause
Under exchangeability, the only reason $Y\not\indep A$ is if $A$ causes $Y$.

\section{Quick Refresher}

\begin{frame}{Potential outcome notation review}
\begin{itemize}
\item We typically use $i$ to denote a generic unit in our study
\item $Y_i$ is the observed outcome for unit $i$
\item $A_i$ is treatment received by unit $i$
\item We typically use $a$ to denote a generic treatment in our study
\item $Y^a_i$ denotes the outcome we would have observed for unit $i$ if assigned treatment value $a$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Potential outcome exercise}
\begin{itemize}
\item We observe that Martha ate a Mediterranean diet, and we observe that Martha survived.
\\ Suppose Martha had eaten a standard diet, we would have observed that Martha survived. 
\item We observe that Ezra ate a standard diet, and we observe that Ezra did not survive
\\ Suppose Ezra had eaten a Mediterranean diet, we would have observed that Ezra survived. 
\end{itemize}
\pause

\vspace{1em}

Assuming \emph{consistency}, what is $A_i$, $Y_i$, $Y_i^{\texttt{MedDiet}}$ and $Y_i^{\texttt{StanDiet}}$
\begin{itemize}
\item When $i = \text{Martha}$?
\item When $i = \text{Ezra}$?

\section{Randomized experiments: Two key benefits}












\begin{frame}{Exchangeability}
\textbf{Definition:} Exchangeability means that the potential outcomes, $Y^{a=1}$ and $Y^{a = 0}$, are independent of the observed treatment ($A$)
\pause
\vspace{1em}

{\small 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two random variables are \textbf{independent} if the outcome of one does not give any information about the outcome of the other
    \pause 
    \item What we would have observed if an individual was given the treatment ($Y^{a = 1}$) is independent of whether or not the individual actually received treatment 
    \item What we would have observed if an individual was not given the treatment ($Y^{a = 0}$) is independent of whether or not the individual actually received treatment  
    \pause 
     \item Exchangeability means that the \textbf{potential} outcomes $Y^a$ are independent of the observed treatment
    \item Exchangeability does \textbf{not} mean that the \textbf{observed} outcome $Y$ is independent of the observed treatment!

In mathematical notation, exchangeability means

\vspace{1em}

\[\underbrace{Y^{a = 1}, Y^{a = 0}}_{\text{potential outcomes}} \indep \underbrace{A}_{\text{observed treatment}} \]




\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is exchangeability good?}
The average causal effect (ACE) is the difference in average outcome that would occur if everyone is treated compared to the average outcome that would occur if no-one is treated   

\vspace{1em}

\[
        \text{ACE} = 
        \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1})}_{\text{if everyone is treated}} - \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 0} )}_{\text{if no-one is treated}} \] 
\pause

\vspace{1em}

The problem is, we only know
\begin{itemize}
    \item  $\E(Y^{a=1} \mid A = 1)$, the average $Y^{a=1}$ among individuals who are actually treated
    \item $\E(Y^{a=0} \mid A = 0)$, the average $Y^{a=0}$ among individuals who are actually not treated
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Why is exchangeability good?}
When exchangeability is true, it implies

\[\underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1}  \mid A = 1)}_{\text{Within treated}} = \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1}  \mid A = 0)}_{\text{Within not treated}} = \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1} )}_{\text{everyone}}  \]


\pause

\vspace{2em}
This allows us to identify the average causal effect (ACE)
\[
        \text{ATE} = 
        \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1} )}_{\text{if everyone is treated}} - \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 0} )}_{\text{if no-one is treated}} \] because we can plug-in 
        \[\underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 1} \mid A = 1)}_{\substack{\text{outcomes for people who} \\ \text{are \textbf{actually} treated}}} \quad \text{ 
        and } \quad  \underbrace{\E(Y^{a = 0} \mid A = 0)}_{\substack{\text{outcomes for people who} \\ \text{are \textbf{actually} not treated}}}\]
