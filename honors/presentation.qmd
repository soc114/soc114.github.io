title: "Presenting orally"
---

Your oral presentation is your chance to tell us about your project. We will discuss some tips that can make for a compelling oral presentation.

* Plan ahead for each person to say a part
* Your oral presentation may mirror your writeup, but you should not be reading it
* Stand with your feet planted and face the group
* Eye contact is a great way to connect with the room while you talk

Some things you might tell us include:

* What motivates this particular question?
* How did you choose your data source and population to study?
* How should we read a point in your graph?
* How should we read the general trend?
* What is your overall finding?

Don't stress about the presentation. We all want everyone to succeed, and the presentation is a way to celebrate the research we have accomplished this quarter.
