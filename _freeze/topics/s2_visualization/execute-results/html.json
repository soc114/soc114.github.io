How do we summarize all of these outcome values? This page focuses on two approaches: visualizing the distribution and producing one or more summary statistics.\n\nAs an example, below we study household income (an outcome) which is defined for each household (a unit of analysis) among all U.S. households in 2022 (a target population).\n\n## Visualizing the distribution\n\nNot all households have the same income: there is a **distribution** of incomes across households. One way to study a distribution is by visualizing it with a histogram.\n\nTo produce this graph, we first downloaded survey data on [annual household income](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/hhincome#description_section) from the 2022 [Current Population Survey](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml). The histogram categorizes households into discrete income groups that are each \\$25,000 wide. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of households falling in that income group. We can see that the most common household income values are below \\$100,000, but a small number of households have very high incomes that create a long upper tail at the right.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](s2_visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe simulated dataset [`incomeSimulated.csv`](../data/incomeSimulated.csv) available on the course website will enable you to produce a similar graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe code below will produce a basic version of this graph. First, you will need to prepare your environment by loading packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for manipulating data\nlibrary(scales)    # for labeling graphs easily\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, you can load the data from the course website.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincomeSimulated <- read_csv(\"https://soc114.github.io/data/incomeSimulated.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code below produces the graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincomeSimulated |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = hhincome)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25e3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Household Income\",\n    labels = label_currency()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](s2_visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's walk through this code in steps.\n\nThis code starts with the dataset `incomeSimulated`. The pipe operator `|>` passes this object as the first argument to the next line (the `data` argument of ``ggplot`). The `ggplot()` line creates the plot. The `mapping` argument defines the aethetics (`aes`) of the plot, with the `hhincome` variable being assigned to the `x`-axis. The `geom_histogram` line produces the plot. The `scale_x_continuous()` lines are an optional part to improve readability of the x-axis.\n\nFor more practice with `ggplot`, see [R4DS Ch 1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html). A particularly good example you can try is section [R4DS 1.2.3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html#creating-a-ggplot).\n\n",
