Below is one hypothetical data table.\n\n| Address | Income | Number of People |\n|---------|-----|-----|\n| 5462 Park St | 54,896 | 2 |\n| 4596 Ocean Ave Apt B | 22,465 | 1 |\n| 6831 River Dr | 134,297 | 4 |\n\n: A hypothetical data table with three households\n\nThe unit of analysis in these data is a household. Each row represents one unit. It is typical that a row of your dataset will correspond to a unit of analysis. Each column contains a variable defined for every unit: the address of the household, annual the household income, and the number of people in the household.\n\n## Data in R\n\nNext we will load these data into R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nbasicData <- read_csv(\"https://soc114.github.io/data/basicData.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you type `basciData` in your R console, you will see a printout of the data. In class, we will use these data to become familiar with the RStudio environment.\n",
